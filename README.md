Number-to-Word Converter

The "Number-to-Word Converter" is a Python program that allows you to convert numerical values into their word representations. It supports numbers up to 16 digits in length, providing a versatile solution for transforming numeric data into human-readable formats.

The program utilizes three dictionaries, D1, D2, and D3, which map numbers to their corresponding word equivalents. These dictionaries ensure accurate and reliable conversion from numeric values to their textual counterparts. The program takes into account various scenarios, including handling zeros, odd and even-length numbers, and the incorporation of the crore unit for numbers exceeding 9 digits.

To use the program, simply call the NumToWord function, passing the desired number as an argument. The function will return the word representation of the number. For example, running NumToWord(9000) will output "nine thousand."

The code is well-structured and provides clear explanations of its components. It incorporates helper functions, such as upto3 and main, to handle different digit counts and ensure accurate conversion. The program is designed to handle a wide range of use cases, making it suitable for financial applications, data analysis, and any other scenario where converting numbers to words is required.
